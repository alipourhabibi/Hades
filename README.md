# Hades Schema Registry

Hades is an open source [Buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf) compatible schema registry.

## Getting started
```bash
docker compose -f development/docker-compose-dev.yaml up -d
go run ./cmd/hades/. serve --config config/dev.yaml
```

## Development env
For development purposes you need to follow these steps:

Add `example.com` to hosts
```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 example.com" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Allow the app to run on port 443
```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

The Buf CLI expects the app to run on port 443 with TLS enabled.
Set up TLS certificates:
Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for self-signed certificates
Generate certificates by running:
```bash
mkcert -install
cd config && mkcert example.com && cd ..
```

You also need to do the migrations:
```bash
make migrate-up
```

Copy the sample config file and fill it with proper configs.
```bash
cp config/config.sample.yaml config/dev.yaml
```

And run the application
```bash
go run ./cmd/hades/. serve --config config/dev.yaml
```

### Initialize development environment
cd into development folder
```bash
./install_tools.sh
./init.sh
```

- Creates a user: googleapis / googleapis
- Creates a module: googleapis with sample protos
- Sets up a project in protos/simpleproject that depends on the googleapis module

I coded this fast, focusing on getting things working first rather than following the best practices from day one. So thereâ€™s room for improvement, refactoring, and optimizations.

If you spot something that could be improved, better architecture, cleaner code, or best practices, feel free to open an issue or a PR. Your contributions are highly appreciated!

Enjoy hacking on Hades!  

### Features ready to tests:
1. buf dep update
2. buf push
Navigate to `development/protos/simpleproject` and run:  

```bash
buf dep update  # Updates the googleapis dependency
buf generate    # Generates code
```
NOTE: the SKD module is not yet developed.

You can also change the protos in `development/protos/googleapis` and then push them using `buf push`

#### Licensing
This project includes files from Google APIs for development purposes, which are licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See the `LICENSE` file in `development/protos/googleapis` for details.

### Docker
```bash
docker run -v ./config/config.yaml:/app/config/config.yaml DOCKER_IMAGE:TAG
```
Mount TLS certificates and adjust ports/configs according to config/config.yaml.
